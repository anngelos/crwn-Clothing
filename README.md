## `About the project`
The project was created in conjunction with the Complete React Developer in 2023 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL) course by instructor Andrei Neagoie and Yihua Zhang on the Udemy platform. This course provided many teachings, among which I highlight Redux, which is very important in the life of a developer today. This application is a result from my studies with Firebase, Redux/Redux Saga and I hope you enjoy it!
